## System requirements

BunsenLabs is a Debian Jessie desktop with custom configurations and
some additions. Hence, the [hardware
recommendations][HardwareRequirements] from the Debian project apply for
both 32bit and 64bit systems:

|RAM (minimum)|RAM (recommended)|Hard Drive |
|:-----------:|:---------------:|:---------:|
| 256M        | 1G              | 10G       |

Depending on the applications and feature set you decide to use
(especially if you do not run a graphical desktop), the system may run
fine with less resources. An installation from the live ISOs uses
approximately 2.1G of space on the hard drive.

## Live CD/DVD/USB key install

This is the preferred and officially supported installation method. You
first download a so-called hybrid ISO image which, depending on size, is
suitable for writing to a CD/DVD medium or a USB key drive. Then, after
booting from the installation medium, you have the chance to test the
Bunsen desktop and install the system to your computer.

After downloading the ISO file from one of the sources below, you may
find help with burning the file to disk or writing to a USB key in the
Debian FAQ section:

* How to write an ISO image under [Linux/Unix][LinuxFAQ],
  [Windows][WindowsFAQ] or [Mac OS X][OSXFAQ]?
* [How to write a CD/DVD/BD image to a USB flash drive][USBFAQ]?

<div class="info">
To log in after booting the live session, enter the username **user** and
the password **live**.

### Downloads

If you can use BitTorrent, please do so as to keep load off our server.
If possible, please leave the client open for a while so you can seed
the files for other users. Via BitTorrent, you will also be able to
download significantly faster -- especially if you are not in Europe
where our servers are located.

Otherwise, use the direct download links. Do not forget to verify direct
downloads using the checksum file provided[^2]. Use the provided OpenPGP
signature to verify any download[^3].

There is a [section](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewforum.php?id=14)
on the forums which deals with any issues, bugs and comments related to
the current release.

The 32bit ISO contains only a PAE-enabled kernel. If you have a platform
that doesn't support
[PAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension),
download `@@ISO_32CD@@` which comes with a non-PAE kernel instead.

[^2]: Place the file containing the checksums in the same directory as
your ISO file downloads, and then run in a terminal `sha256sum --check
${CHECKSUM_FILE}`. Make sure to pass the name of the `*.sha256sum.txt`
file, and **not** the ISO file!

[^3]: We use our [release key][releasekey] for signing. Import the key
into your local user's keyring by executing `gpg --import <(wget -qO-
https://pkg.bunsenlabs.org/BunsenLabs-RELEASE.asc)`.  Verify the
signature by downloading both the ISO file and the signature file to the
same directory and invoking GnuPG as follows: `gpg --verify
${SIGNATURE_FILE} ${ISO_FILE}`. GnuPG should tell you that you passed it
a 'good signature'.

## Package-based install

You may also choose to follow our repository set-up
[instructions](http://pkg.bunsenlabs.org) and include our package
repository into your Debian existing system. This way, you can
selectively install [packages from the BunsenLabs
project](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/repoidx.html?k=name-description&v=bunsen-)
and use only a subset of our configurations and assets.

The packages are built and made to be installed on Debian Jessie
systems. However, depending on the package, it may be possible to
install on the Debian old-stable release
[Wheezy](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianWheezy) and current
[Ubuntu](http://releases.ubuntu.com/) releases.

### netinstall script

It is also possible to include the BunsenLabs system into a minimal
[netinstall](https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/) Debian installation
using a special script. Please consult its
[README](https://github.com/BunsenLabs/bunsen-netinstall) for detailed
instructions. There is also a [forum thread](http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=39656)
on this topic.
