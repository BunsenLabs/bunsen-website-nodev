## Defining features

The distribution consists of configuration and resource packages
installed on top of Debian. There are no changes to the way the Debian
base system is administrated.

* Pre-configured [Openbox](http://openbox.org/wiki/Main_Page) window
  manager with [tint2](https://gitlab.com/o9000/tint2) panel and
  [conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/) system monitor
* Assortment of harmonising GTK2/3 themes, wallpapers and
  [conky](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky) configurations
* Various configuration and application utilities to maintain this
  system
* Additional desktop-, multimedia- and hardware-related packages come
  pre-installed to offer a better "out-of-the-box" experience.

There is no limit to customization: You can review desktop
configurations in our forums' [Artwork &
Screenshots](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewforum.php?id=8) section,
and we also host [several active
threads](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewforum.php?id=9) on conky
configuration.

## Architectures

We offer combined [live-CD and installation
media](/installation.html#live-cddvdusb-key-method) for the Debian
**i386** (i686) and **amd64** (x86-64) architectures.

However, you can install our [packages](/installation.html#repository-method) also on ARM platforms.
Our repository currently provides **[armhf](https://wiki.debian.org/ArmHardFloatPort)**.
If you would like to see [another Debian ARM port](https://www.debian.org/ports/arm/) supported,
file a request [here](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewforum.php?id=13).
