## Where can I talk to other BL users and developers?

### Official channels

  * [Forums](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org) -- this is our main communication channel

As you may know, we had been using the [CrunchBang Linux forums](http://crunchbang.org/forums)
in the beginning. Registrations over there are now closed, but there's
much knowledge left for you to harvest.
