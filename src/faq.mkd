## Where can I talk to other BL users and developers?

### Official channels

  * [Forums](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org) -- this is our main communication channel
  * IRC channel [#bunsenlabs@freenode](irc://chat.freenode.net:6697/#bunsenlabs)

As you may know, we had been using the [CrunchBang Linux forums](http://crunchbang.org/forums)
in the beginning. Registrations over there are now closed, but there's
much knowledge left for you to harvest.

You can also consume our [News & Announcement](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewforum.php?id=12)
news feed via [Planet Debian](http://planet.debian.org/deriv/).

### Independent channels
  
Unofficial pages have also sprung up elsewhere:

* [DeviantArt group](http://bunsenlabs.deviantart.com/)
* On Google+, there is [BunsenLabs en Español](https://plus.google.com/communities/102155480089831191422)
* User [Balloon](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewtopic.php?pid=8855#p8855) has created an extensive resource in Japanese: [BunsenLabs Japan!・ブンゼンラボ ジャパン！](http://bunsenlabs-jp.jimdo.com/), including instructions and translations for a Japanese localization
* There is a third-party German-speaking forum located [here](https://bunsenlabs-de.lima-city.de/index.php)

## Where is the BL source code?

BunsenLabs is being developed in public, [on Github](https://github.com/BunsenLabs). A commit log summary [is available here](/gitlog.html).
