## Where can I talk to other BL users and developers?

### Official channels

  * [Forums](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org) -- this is our main communication channel

As you may know, we had been using the [CrunchBang Linux forums](http://crunchbang.org/forums)
in the beginning. Registrations over there are now closed, but there's
much knowledge left for you to harvest.

You can also consume our [News & Announcement](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewforum.php?id=12)
news feed via [Planet Debian](http://planet.debian.org/deriv/).

### Independent channels
  
Unofficial pages have also sprung up elsewhere:

* IRC channel [#bunsenlabs@freenode](irc://chat.freenode.net:6697/#bunsenlabs)
* [DeviantArt group](http://bunsenlabs.deviantart.com/)
* On Google+, there is [BunsenLabs en Espa√±ol](https://plus.google.com/communities/102155480089831191422)
* Subreddit [r/BunsenLabs](https://www.reddit.com/r/BunsenLabs/)

## I keep getting a 403 Access Denied error when trying to access the forums!

This is because your IP address is on a IP block list. Please refer to

## How can I get my desktop to look like the ones on the front page's slide show?

You can start by tracking down the original posts on our forums and
looking up what the respective user has done or used to produce the
pictured result. You can download the screenshot sources
