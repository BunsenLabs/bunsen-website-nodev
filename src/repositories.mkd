## Repositories

To use our repositories, follow the instructions below: Set up the APT
configuration and import our signing key.

### bunsen-hydrogen

This is our main repository which contains our core packages.

Set up a file at `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bunsen.list` with the
following [contents][AptSources]:

~~~
deb http://pkg.bunsenlabs.org/debian bunsen-hydrogen main
~~~

### jessie-backports

This is an auxiliary repository containing packages backported from
Debian testing and imported from Ubuntu.

Set up `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bunsen-jessie-backports.list` with the
following [contents][AptSourcesBp]:

~~~
deb http://pkg.bunsenlabs.org/debian jessie-backports main
~~~

The backports repo's packages will have a pin priority of 100, so
regular jessie packages will continue to take precedence until you
explicitly install a backported package.

To upgrade a package to its backports version, target the backports
distribution as follows:

~~~ { .bash }
sudo apt-get -t jessie-backports install ${PACKAGE_NAME}
~~~

Subsequent package upgrades will be installed from the backports repo or
the regular repository, whichever package version is
higher.

### unstable

This repository contains some packages built for Debian testing and
unstable and is not part of BunsenLabs. See the package list
[here](https://pkg.bunsenlabs.org/repoidx.html#unstable).

~~~
deb http://pkg.bunsenlabs.org/debian unstable main
~~~

### Source archives

Package sources may be retrieved using the `apt-get source` command. To
be able to do so, duplicate the lines in your `.list` files and
change the archive type to [`deb-src`](https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList#Archive_type).

## Package search

<form action="/repoidx.html" method="get" style="text-align:center">
<select id="filter-key" title="Select the package property to filter by" name="k" style="width:20%;display:inline;">
<option value="any">Any metadata field</option>
<option value="depends">Depends</option>
<option value="maintainer">Maintainer</option>
<option value="name-description" selected="selected">Name or Descr</option>
<option value="recommends">Recommneds</option>
<option value="section">Section</option>
<option value="suggests">Suggests</option>
<option value="version">Version</option>
</select>
<input id="filter-value" style="width:75%;display:inline;" type="text" name="v" minlength="1">
</form>

You can also just browse the list [here](/repoidx.html).

## Mirrors

We currently operate two repository mirrors. If you specify the host
`pkg.bunsenlabs.org` in your APT configuration, you will be redirected
automatically to the preferred server based on your IP addresses
geolocation:

* Users residing in Australia, Oceania and Asia get redirected to
  `asia.pkg.bunsenlabs.org`; the server is located in Singapore.
* Other users stay on `pkg.bunsenlabs.org` which is identical with
  `eu.pkg.bunsenlabs.org`; the server is located in Germany.

If you get redirected to `asia.pkg.bunsenlabs.org` but notice that your
ISP has a faster route to the EU server than the Singapore one, put
`eu.pkg.bunsenlabs.org` into your APT configuration in order to opt out
from the redirect. Similarly, users in Europe, the Americas or Africa
for whom `asia.pkg.bunsenlabs.org` is faster should switch to that mirror.

### Access via HTTPS

You may change the `http://` prefix in your BL repository URLs to
`https://` in order to access the repositories using an encrypted
connection. Before setting this up, ensure that the package
[`apt-transport-https`](https://packages.debian.org/search?suite=all&searchon=names&exact=1&keywords=apt-transport-https)
is installed on your system. The package is part of the BL standard
installation.

<div class="warning">
You might see `apt-get update` complaining sporadically with the error:
`W: Size of file [...] is not what the server reported`. apt has some
strange issues in conjunction with apt-transport-https which are hard to
debug despite having been declared fixed before (e.g. Debian bug
#802617). As a workaround, either ignore the messages or do not use
apt-transport-https.
</div>

## Signing key

The preferred method for installing our archive key on your system is
using the provided keyring package.

### Keyring package

Download the latest .deb keyring package and install it:

~~~ {.bash}
wget https://pkg.bunsenlabs.org/debian/pool/main/b/bunsen-keyring/bunsen-keyring_2016.7.2-1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i bunsen-keyring_2016.7.2-1_all.deb
sudo apt-get update
~~~

### Manual setup

Fetch and verify the repository's [signing key][SigningKey]:

~~~ { .bash }
wget https://pkg.bunsenlabs.org/BunsenLabs-RELEASE.asc
gpg --with-fingerprint BunsenLabs-RELEASE.asc
~~~

The key's fingerprint as displayed by gpg should be identical with the
following hexstring:

~~~~~
3172 4784 0522 7490 BBB7 43E6 A067 3F72 FE62 D9C5 
~~~~~

If that is not the case, you have got the wrong key. Use a safe,
non-intercepted internet connection in order to retrieve the correct key
file.

Finally, add the key to APT and update the package index:

~~~ { .bash }
sudo apt-key add BunsenLabs-RELEASE.asc
sudo apt-get update
~~~

You may now install <monospace>bunsen-\*</monospace> packages provided
by the repository.
