# Stuff We Use

We use a number of open-source technologies for running this project. For
the curious, here is a curated list:

* [Debian](https://debian.org) and [Ubuntu Server](http://www.ubuntu.com/server) as server operating systems
* [FluxBB](https://fluxbb.org/) forum software
* [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) for signing packages and ISO images
* [LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/) for running multiple services well-separated from each other on the same server
* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
* [OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com/) and [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) for shuffling data around
* [git](https://git-scm.com/) for our VCS, [gitea](https://gitea.io) as a repository browser
* [netdata](https://github.com/firehol/netdata) as an UNIX-y, awesome monitoring dashboard
* [nginx](http://nginx.org/) is what we use for our webserver and web-facing load balancer. It also blocks spammers using a blocklist provided by the [Stop-Forum-Spam](https://stopforumspam.com/) project: We regularly fetch the list as a CSV file from a [cronjob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacron), transform it using sed and then pass it on to nginx as a configuration file which nginx just includes from its main configuration.
* [opentracker](https://erdgeist.org/arts/software/opentracker/) is our bittorrent tracker; the torrent files are generated using [buildtorrent](https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Buildtorrent). opentracker is a bit weird in that it needs to be compiled once for IPv4, and once for IPv6 -- otherwise a very neat tool.
* [pandoc](http://pandoc.org) generates our static main web site, supported by scripts using [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) for bitmap and  [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) for vector graphics processing as well as text processing scripts using [GNU sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/) and the [GNU coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html) (of course there's some stray Python too). The build system is [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), which also makes for a surprisingly simple but flexible templating system.
* [pbuilder](https://pbuilder.alioth.debian.org/) builds our packages for i386, amd64 and ARM architectures
* [reprepro](https://mirrorer.alioth.debian.org/) manages our Debian package repository
* [vnstat](http://humdi.net/vnstat/) is a network traffic monitor with database functionality. We put up graphs generated by `vnstati` on our interal dashboard.

## Retired systems

* [InfluxDB](https://influxdata.com/) for storing time-series data collected by collectd
* [collectd](https://collectd.org/) for collecting metrics from the system, forum database, webserver, etc
* [gogs](https://gogs.io/) Git frontend for internal repos and mirroring
