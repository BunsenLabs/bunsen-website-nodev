## newsserver

Small service exposing the Announcement forums' news feed in two
formats:

  * JSON @ https://www.bunsenlabs.org/feed/news
  * Atom feed @ https://www.bunsenlabs.org/feed/news/atom

The service rewrites the summary of each topic to be the first paragraph
of the OP, whereas the FluxBB native feeds always show the latest post
in the topic in this position.

The data is used to power the dynamic news section on the BL website
(JSON) as well as to feed into Planet Debian (Atom).
